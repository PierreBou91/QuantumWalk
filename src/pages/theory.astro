    <!-- Many Worlds Interpretation -->

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-cosmic-purple">Many Worlds Interpretation</h2>

      <p class="text-star-white/80 mb-4">
        The <strong>Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI)</strong> of quantum mechanics, proposed by
        Hugh Everett III in 1957, suggests that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements
        actually occur—each in its own separate universe or "branch."
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-star-white">Key Concepts</h3>

      <div class="space-y-4 text-star-white/80 mb-6">
        <div class="bg-cosmic-black/40 rounded-lg p-4">
          <h4 class="font-semibold text-cosmic-blue mb-2">Universal Wave Function</h4>
          <p class="text-sm">
            In MWI, the entire universe is described by a single quantum wave function that never collapses.
            Instead, it continuously evolves according to the Schrödinger equation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-cosmic-black/40 rounded-lg p-4">
          <h4 class="font-semibold text-cosmic-blue mb-2">Branching</h4>
          <p class="text-sm">
            When a quantum measurement occurs, the universe "branches" into multiple parallel
            versions—one for each possible outcome. Each branch is equally real.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-cosmic-black/40 rounded-lg p-4">
          <h4 class="font-semibold text-cosmic-blue mb-2">No Collapse</h4>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Unlike the Copenhagen interpretation, MWI eliminates the need for wave function
            collapse. All possibilities exist simultaneously in different branches.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-cosmic-black/40 rounded-lg p-4">
          <h4 class="font-semibold text-cosmic-blue mb-2">Decoherence</h4>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Quantum decoherence explains why we don't observe superpositions in everyday life.
            Interaction with the environment causes branches to become effectively independent.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="text-star-white/80">
        MWI is one of several interpretations of quantum mechanics and remains actively debated
        among physicists and philosophers. It offers advantages in terms of mathematical elegance
        and avoiding arbitrary wave function collapse, but raises questions about the "reality"
        of countless parallel universes.

    <!-- The Thought Experiment -->
    <div class="bg-cosmic-black/60 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-2xl p-8 border border-cosmic-blue/30 mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-cosmic-blue">The Quantum Walk Thought Experiment</h2>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-star-white">The Central Question</h3>
      <p class="text-star-white/80 mb-4">
        If the Many Worlds interpretation is correct, and if parallel branches share a common
        origin and fundamental constants, <em>could there exist deterministic patterns that are
        identical across all branches?</em>
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-star-white">The Hypothesis</h3>
      <div class="bg-cosmic-purple/10 border border-cosmic-purple/30 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
        <p class="text-star-white/90">
          <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> A purely deterministic algorithm, starting from a universal
          reference point (Unix Epoch 0), using only mathematical operations and cryptographic
          hashing, would generate the <em>exact same sequence</em> in every branch of the multiverse.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-star-white">The Implication</h3>
      <p class="text-star-white/80 mb-4">
        If an external signal were detected that matches a subsequence of the Quantum Walk intervals,
        and we could rigorously verify it was <strong>not</strong> generated locally, it might suggest:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-star-white/80 mb-4 ml-4">
        <li>The signal originated from an intelligent source</li>
        <li>That source had access to the same deterministic algorithm</li>
        <li>The source shares our fundamental constants and mathematical framework</li>
        <li>It could potentially be from another branch of the multiverse</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-star-white/80">
        This would not <em>prove</em> the Many Worlds interpretation, but it would be an intriguing
        data point worthy of further investigation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Challenges & Criticisms -->

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-yellow-400">Challenges & Criticisms</h2>

      <p class="text-star-white/80 mb-4">
        This thought experiment makes several strong assumptions that may not hold:
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-4 text-star-white/80">
        <div class="bg-cosmic-black/40 rounded-lg p-4">
          <h4 class="font-semibold text-yellow-400 mb-2">1. Cross-Branch Communication</h4>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Standard MWI suggests branches become independent through decoherence. There's no
            known mechanism for information transfer between branches. Any such mechanism would
            require entirely new physics.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-cosmic-black/40 rounded-lg p-4">
          <h4 class="font-semibold text-yellow-400 mb-2">2. Shared Determinism</h4>
          <p class="text-sm">
            While fundamental constants might be the same across branches (depending on interpretation),
            it's unclear whether computational processes or technological development would follow
            identical paths. Different quantum outcomes could lead to vastly different histories.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-cosmic-black/40 rounded-lg p-4">
          <h4 class="font-semibold text-yellow-400 mb-2">3. Signal Detection</h4>
          <p class="text-sm">
            How would we distinguish a signal from another branch from:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-xs ml-4 mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Random noise that happens to match</li>
            <li>A locally-generated hoax or test</li>
            <li>Natural phenomena with similar patterns</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-cosmic-black/40 rounded-lg p-4">
          <h4 class="font-semibold text-yellow-400 mb-2">4. Reference Point Assumption</h4>
          <p class="text-sm">
            The algorithm uses Unix Epoch (Jan 1, 1970) as its starting point—a human convention.
            Why would another branch use the same convention unless they developed identical
            computing standards? This seems unlikely given quantum divergence.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-cosmic-black/40 rounded-lg p-4">
          <h4 class="font-semibold text-yellow-400 mb-2">5. Mathematical Coincidence</h4>
          <p class="text-sm">
            With enough data and enough attempts, random sequences can appear to match.
            Statistical significance would be extremely difficult to establish without
            prior knowledge of what to look for.
